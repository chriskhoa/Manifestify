# Manifesitfy React App

**Manifesitfy** is a productivity-focused React application designed to help users manage and track their job applications while staying motivated throughout their job search journey.

## 🚀 Overview

In the final version of our project, we have implemented the following features:

- ✅ **Job Form Component**  
  Allows users to add new job opportunities. Each entry is added directly into the job table for tracking.

- ✅ **Job Table Component**  
  A dynamic and interactive table to monitor job applications. Key features include:

  - Expandable rows to view more information
  - Searching and filtering by status or keyword
  - Inline editing to update job information quickly

- ✅ **Streak Counter Component**  
  Tracks the total number of job applications submitted. Includes a motivational message and a celebratory emoji to keep users engaged.

- ✅ **Motivation Generator Component**  
  Displays a new motivational message each time the user clicks the button, providing positivity and encouragement.

- ✅ **Daily Goal-Setting Component**  
  Allows users to set daily job application goals and track progress visually.

- ✅ **Local Storage Integration**  
  Saves the user’s progress locally to prevent data loss during sessions.

## ❌ Features Not Yet Achieved

While we are proud of our progress, there were a few features we did not complete:

- ❌ Tracking how many days users meet their daily goals.
- ❌ Adding animated feedback (e.g., clapping emoji) when a job status changes.
- ❌ Displaying contextual motivational messages based on job status (e.g., messages tailored to “rejected” status).
- ❌ No reset filter function in Job Table.

## 🤯 Challenges & Reflections

- **Merge Conflicts**  
  Collaboratively merging our individually developed components was a major learning point. Handling merge conflicts—especially during integration—was a tough but valuable experience.

- **Table Usability**  
  We spent considerable time refining the usability of the job table. This involved ensuring that the column layout and information hierarchy made sense to a typical user.

## 🔮 Future Plans

To enhance and scale up Manifesitfy, we plan to:

- 🔐 **Implement Backend with User Authentication**  
  Migrate data from local storage to a secure backend system to persist user data reliably across devices and sessions.

- 🛠 **Customizable Tracking Fields**  
  Allow users to personalize the job form and table, choosing which fields they want to display or track.

- 🗂 **Multi-Table Support**  
  Introduce multiple tabs or dashboards, enabling users to manage job applications across different categories or projects.
